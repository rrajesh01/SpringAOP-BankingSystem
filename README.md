# SpringAOP-BankingSystem
A simple banking system simulation using Spring Framework with Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) for handling logging and transactional concerns. This project demonstrates real-world AOP use-cases with @Before, @After, @AfterReturning, @AfterThrowing, and @Around advices in a modular and maintainable way.
